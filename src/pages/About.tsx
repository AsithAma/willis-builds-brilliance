          Willis Construction is a longstanding family run business established by Gareth Williams in 1986, and its values reflect this. Our key strength is our people, and we are unique in the diverse range of construction activities undertaken with 3 key divisions: New Build Development, Major Refurbishment & Maintenance, and Insurance Repairs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Willis has a loyal, trusted, well trained and vastly experienced team who pride themselves on building to programme, producing excellent quality and maintaining budgets for clients. We believe in collaboration and shared learning to maximise results, continually learning from our business divisions, past projects, and input from subcontract trades, consultants, client and specialist suppliers, ensuring customer satisfaction is at the heart of all we do.
        </p>
        <p>
          We encourage and engage regularly with the industry supply chain to learn from their experiences and innovate solutions into new schemes to benefit delivery and improve client satisfaction. These may be permanent features into the design or indeed methods of construction which improve projects.

          We pride ourselves on our commitment to help in achieving sustainable communities and strive to reinforce the aims of client organisations and those outlined within our Social Value strategy.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are not a management contracting company and are therefore equipped to directly support Targeted Recruitment & Training (TR&T) initiatives at first hand without having to place the participants with our sub-contract supply chain. We already play a proactive role with our clients and participate in creating employment and training opportunities and also have experience of delivering requirements under the CIH "Can Do Toolkit" clauses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our contribution to the communities in which we work with is fundamental to the business, and our social value activities positively contribute to the Welsh Economy, whether that's through the use of local supply chain, our TR&T activities, or our community benefits engagement.
